##  Introduction
Welcome to the Calculator Project, a simple yet powerful web-based calculator built by a newbie coder. This calculator provides basic arithmetic operations in a user-friendly interface, making it suitable for students, professionals, and anyone in need of quick calculations.

##  Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Clear and delete functionalities for easy correction.
- Error handling for division by zero to ensure accurate calculations.
- Responsive design for seamless usage on various devices.

## Process
This project was developed iteratively, with a focus on learning and experimentation. The development process involved:

1. **Planning**: Initial brainstorming and outlining of project requirements and features.
2. **Implementation**: Writing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to create the calculator functionality and user interface.
3. **Testing**: Thorough testing of the calculator to ensure correct behavior and responsiveness.
4. **Refinement**: Iterative refinement of code and design based on feedback and testing results.

## What I Learned
Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable experience and learned several key concepts, including:

- Manipulating the DOM with JavaScript to create dynamic user interfaces.
- Utilizing CSS variables for consistent and maintainable styling.
- Implementing error handling and validation for user inputs.
- Working with event listeners to capture user interactions and trigger actions.

## How It Could Be Improved

While the Calculator Project achieves its basic functionality, there are several areas where it could be improved:

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling for edge cases and unexpected user inputs.
- **Scientific Calculator Features**: Add advanced mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions, square root, and exponentiation.
- **Accessibility**: Improve accessibility features to ensure the calculator is usable by a wider range of users, like keyboard shortcuts usage.
- **Optimization**: Optimize code and performance to improve load times and responsiveness, especially on slower devices.

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply click on the number buttons to input numbers and select an operator (+, -, *, /) using the corresponding buttons. Press the equal (=) button to calculate the result. You can clear the current input by using the "AC" button or delete the last digit with the "DEL" button.
